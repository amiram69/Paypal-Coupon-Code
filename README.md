Easy-PayPal-Discount-Code
=========================

I've seen many complicated ways to implement a discount code for PayPal. This is a much more simple approach.
Many tutorials I've seen use PhP and creating multiple buttons, or a complicated .js file that will alter the price. PayPal has a discount_rate variable that can be set using this simple javascript code.

First create a buy now button, uncheck to save the button. Navigate down to #3 and check advanced variables, add "discount_rate=0". After this create the button and when copying the code click the 'Remove code protection' first. Modify the code I have uploaded to your specific coupon codes and ID's.
